# DEFRA MAGIC Map Service Loader Plugin for QGIS
The plugin allows you to open the DEFRA MAGIC map service from QGIS. It will load the MAGIC map of the area you are zoomed to in QGIS. DEFRA's MAGIC service is UK only.

Once enabled, the plugin will create a new button on the toolbar to open the MAGIC map service for the current map extent.
The service is only available in the UK, and as such, requires the map projection to be set to British National Grid (EPSG: 27700)
